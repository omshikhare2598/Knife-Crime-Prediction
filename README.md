# Modelling Knife Crime Data with Societal Factors in London.
## Description
Project aims is to analyse different societal factors across London. Finding socio-economic factors such as Economic inactivity rates, Poverty rates, Population demographics, Qualifications, etc of each London borough. Incorporate data mining techniques to find how these vary and pattern recognition. Building a set of Machine Learning regression algorithms on societal features to in order to train the model to predict knife crime offences across London.

All of the datasets were taken from the UK government's official publicly available datasets.
* Crime Data (MOPAC)

* Qualification levels.
